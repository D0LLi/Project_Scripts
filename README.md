# Project_Scripts

Some project scripts i was working on while I was learning Powershell and Python.

I wanted to see what real world scenarios I was able to create.

Python Projects

1) Data Scraper (Get Data from a website using a filtered selection and print it to screen)
2) Filter Data (Get Data and filter it using Reg Expressions)
3) Photo Album Scraper (Download Images from a website from an album and sort them out via Directories)
4) Website Url Scanner (Scan a list of websites if they are avaliable , found out the technologies they are using to create the website and export it to a csv file)


Powershell Project

1) Clone Virtual Machine on a StandAlone Esxi Server. (Create a copy of a virtual machine without the use of Vcenter Server and then be able to join it to a domain if your vcenter server goes down)
